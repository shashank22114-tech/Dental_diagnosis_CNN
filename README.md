# Dental Radiograph Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify dental radiographs for detection of periodontal disease.  
A convolutional neural network was trained on dental X-ray images to identify pathological patterns and assist diagnosis.

The model achieves **93% validation accuracy** on the test dataset.

This project was built as part of my machine learning portfolio and demonstrates experience with medical image classification, training pipelines, and evaluation metrics.
